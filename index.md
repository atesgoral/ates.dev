## JavaScript Golfing

I write verbose, readable code at work, and go nuts with unreadable JavaScript in my spare time.

### Backend-less UI Development

While the modern web development environment has many tools for easily setting up and running your backend (via package managers, dependency managers, migrations, etc.), there are still some advantages to having a simple mock backend that allows a single-page application to be run literally after a simple checkout. I will show a simple exploit to use any static web server as your mock backend. An HTTP transport adaptor for your favourite library (jQuery being one) can also be used for the best effect; simulating HTTP verbs, HTTP response codes, as well as latency.
