Hi! I'm <strong>Ateş Göral</strong>. I enjoy writing code, tinkering with graphics, experimenting with electronics, and executing ambitious DIY projects.

I'm a self-taught programmer with 25+ years of professional and 35+ years of hobbyist experience. I'm a telco and web veteran with both breadth and depth, spanning multiple programming languages, disciplines, and technologies. I also have an ornamental Associate of Science degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics.

Currently: Principal Engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), working with AI.

Past: [Orium](https://orium.com/) (Myplanet), [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/) (Alcatel-Lucent, VoiceGenie), PhonoClick, Turk Nokta Net. And a whole bunch of odd jobs.
