  <h2>Joystick Hack</h2>
  <p class="meta">Posted on Jan 19, 2025</p>

  <div class="content"><p>What follows is the first electronics mod I did as a child, with no artifacts to
show for it. Circa late 1980s.</p>
<p>We didn't have digital cameras back then and I didn't have the foresight to take
process photos using a regular camera, and didn't even think of keeping the
modded monstosity as a keepsake. You'll just have to take my word for it. All
images shown are others' photos from the Internet. Sigh.</p>
<h3 id="the-priming" tabindex="-1"><a class="permalink" href="#the-priming">The priming</a></h3>
<p>Growing up, we had an Atari 2600 Video Game Console, with CX10 joysticks to go
with it. An issue with the joytics, or our forceful use of them was, the
tripod-like metal contacts/springs that were taped to the PCB used to crack and
flatten. And the joystick would stop working for the direction of the flattened
contact.</p>
<p>My dad, an architect/photographer household handyman and an audophile, wasn't
shy of cracking open electronics to do simple repairs. To spark the DIY
electronics repairer in me, all he had to do was to demonstrate how to open the
joysticks to unbend/reposition the metal contacts. I did all future joystick
repairs.</p>
<p>And the PCB + wiring was very simple to understand: Just 6 wires
connected to ground, and 5 contacts: One for each direction and one for the fire
button.</p>
<h3 id="the-opportunity" tabindex="-1"><a class="permalink" href="#the-opportunity">The opportunity</a></h3>
<p>Fast forward to many years later. I'm visiting my cousin and we're gaming on his
Commodore 64. My cousing as autofire joysticks, which I never bothered buying.
One of his autofire joysticks was physically broken and he was preparing to toss
it out in the garbage. I said I wanted to examing it and took it from him.
After my innate understanding of a standard non-autofire joystick, I was very
curious about what made these autofire joysticks tick.</p>
<p>I know nothing beyond &quot;if you touch to metals, electricity flows through them&quot;
at this point.</p>
<h3 id="the-hack" tabindex="-1"><a class="permalink" href="#the-hack">The hack</a></h3>
<p>I take the joystick home, unscrew the housing and start examinig the PCB. The
jostick is physically broken (I don't remember the specifics), but the PCB is
intact. Superimposing my knowledge of a basic joystick on top of the
incomprehensible circuit elements of the autofire PCB, I was able to
reverse-engineer this much: An extra wire runs into the joystick. I use my dad's
circuit tester to see that it's supplying +5V. The contact parts are mostly the
same, but there's this island of circuity that must be the source of the
autofire.</p>
<p>And here's the literal hack: I hacksawed the autofire bit out of the broken
joystick, and soldered it into a standard joystick that I was using with my
Atari ST. I ran a single wire I salvaged from on old headphone and superglued it
along the 6-pole wire of the standard joystick. I replaced the top fire button
of my joystick with a lamp toggle switch, which fit perfectly into the opening.
IT WORKED! I had a Frankenstein's monster of a joystick with an autofire circuit
retrofitted on it like a parasite. I had click the toggle switch on the top to
turn on autofire and click again to turn it off.</p>
<p>Courage, luck, success. Whatever confidence I had in all the other electronics
mods I did in later life, I trace back to this first hack.</p>
<p>Literal hack, with a hacksaw involved.</p>
